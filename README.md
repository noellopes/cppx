# cppx

The initial goal of cppx project is to make C++ code easier to maintain.

Often, when creating a new C++ class, the programmer typically creates two files: a header file (.h) and a source code file (.cpp). Moreover, performing changes in a specific class, usually involves changing both files. The idea of cppx is to allow programmers to maintain the code in a single (.cppx) file, which is then used to generate the .h and .cpp files prior to compilation.

At a latter phase the project will also aim to enforce good programming practices and simplify programming tasks.
